4. Release History
------------------

V1.2.0 : 01/07/2019
	1. Kernel is upgraded to 4.9.
	2. Switch ports can be remapped.  Now the host port is always the last
	   one to the users.  This change only affects KSZ9897 as the host
	   port can be any.
	3. Fix some MRP/MSRP/gPTP test failures.

V1.1.9 : 02/12/2018
	1. Fix Linux PTP stack problems running in E2E/P2P as eth0.100 devices
	   are used.
	2. Fix some MRP/MSRP/gPTP test failures.
	3. Rely on MVRP only to program VLAN table for MSRP operation.

V1.1.8 : 12/15/2017
	1. Support KSZ9563 and KSZ8563 connected to UNG8087_B.
	2. Fix RSTP disable/enable problem.

V1.1.7 : 11/28/2017
	1. Fix FQTSS credit shaper problems.

V1.1.6 : 11/07/2017
	1. Enable STP by default as multiple devices mode 3 requires that.
	2. Fix MSRP encoding problem.

V1.1.5 : 11/02/2017
	1. Use eth0.100 devices for 802.1AS instead of VLAN devices.

V1.1.4 : 10/19/2017
	1. Fix some MRP/MSRP problems.  Allow manual bandwidth configuration.

V1.1.3 : 09/28/2017
	1. Fix some MRP/MSRP test failures.

V1.1.2 : 07/19/2017
	1. Linux PTP utilities are updated to better support the PTP stack.
	2. An SD card can be used to boot and run the system.

V1.1.1 : 05/03/2017
	1. Linux PTP is updated to version 1.8.  The pmc utility can use
	   Management messages to pass information from the PTP stack.  There
	   is an explicit command to change the neighborPropDelayThresh and
	   asCapable settings on the fly.
	2. MSTP support is added to KSZ9897.  It is still not enabled by
	   default and requires manual kernel configuration to enable it.  The
	   old RSTP code is still being used.

V1.1.0 : 02/08/2017
	1. Newer revision of UNG8071 board is used.  As such the GPIO
	   interrupt is changed from 10 to 28.
	2. DLR daemon is added to communicate with DLR management program so
	   that a DLR demo can be run.
	3. The Atmel Cadence MAC driver can use IBA-only mode for demo
	   purpose.
	4. The MAC and switch drivers can be run as modules and unloaded.
	5. UNG8087 board is supported.  However, it requires a different
	   Device Tree configuration as the RGMII setting is different.

V1.0 : 12/23/2016 
	1. Ethernet Switch Driver with VLAN, ACL, 802.1x, RSTP support.
	2. LinuxPTP, OpenAVB support -  Beta version.
	3. DLR , HSR support - Beta version

5. Known Issues:
---------------

It is expected RSTP is turned on when the multiple devices mode 3 is used.
Without RSTP the ports will stay partitioned so there is no forwarding in the
switch until it is manually configured.

6. New Features Added:
---------------------

A.

MAC_Operational can be turned off.

echo 0 > sw#/#_mac_oper

An alternate way is to use ifconfig command to disable the port:

ifconfig eth0.10# down

To enable the port again it requires using the ifconfig command:

ifconfig eth0.10# up

If the #_mac_oper command is used it is required to use the ifconfig command to
disable the port first:

ifconfig eth0.10# down
ifconfig eth0.10# up


B.

MMRP/MVRP can set Non-Participant, which means the applicant does not declare
anything.  The applicant is type based, so it is simple to just turn on/off
the attribute type supported.

echo 0 > sw#/#_mmrp_mac
echo 0 > sw#/#_mvrp_vid


C.

MMRP/MVRP can set Fixed Registration, which means the registration state is
always IN.  The registration is value based, so a value needs to be entered
first to select Fixed Registration:

echo 01:02:03:04:05:06 > sw/alu_addr
echo 1 > sw#/#_mmrp_reg

echo 2 > sw/vlan_index
echo 1 > sw#/#_mvrp_reg


D.

MMRP/MVRP can set Forbidden Registration, which means the registration state
is always MT.  The registration is value based, so a value needs to be entered
first to select Forbidden Registration:

echo 01:02:03:04:05:06 > sw/alu_addr
echo 2 > sw#/#_mmrp_reg

echo 2 > sw/vlan_index
echo 2 > sw#/#_mvrp_reg


Normal Registration is set by writing 0:

echo 01:02:03:04:05:06 > sw/alu_addr
echo 0 > sw#/#_mmrp_reg

echo 2 > sw/vlan_index
echo 0 > sw#/#_mvrp_reg


E.

MVRP can set Restricted_VLAN_Registration, which means the VLAN will not be
registered when an entry is not already in the VLAN table.

echo 2 > sw/vlan_index
echo 1 > sw#/#_vlan_restricted


F.

MSRP can be disabled globablly.

echo 0 > sw/msrpEnabled


G.

MSRP can be disabled by port.

echo 0 > sw#/#_msrpEnabled


H.

MSRP deltaBandwidth can be set.

echo 3 > sw#/#_q_index
echo 75 > sw#/#_q_delta
echo 2 > sw#/#_q_index
echo 0 > sw#/#_q_delta

It is required to write the SR Class B deltaBandwidth last to set both
deltaBandwidths.


I.

MSRP adminIdleSlope can be set.

echo 3 > sw#/#_q_index
echo 7500 > sw#/#_q_admin_slope

The number 7500 means 75.00%.


J.

MSRP SR Class A can be disabled.

echo 0 > sw/msrp_sr_a


K.

Following workarounds can be used to pass AVnu tests.  They are meant to show
the tests can be passed by modifying the test procedures or their
expectations.  These test cases will be reviewed to decide whether anything
should be fixed or not.

For MRP.c.10.1.2f:

echo mrp_10.1.2f > sw/msrp_info


For MRP.c.10.5.1c:

echo mrp_10.5.1c > sw/msrp_info


For MRP.c.10.5.1d:

echo mrp_10.5.1d > sw/msrp_info


For MSRP.c.35.1.5e:

echo regeneration > sw/msrp_info

This does not have any real effect on the correctness of the operation.


For FQTSS.c.34.2.3a:

echo fqtss_34.2.3 > sw/msrp_info

This just allows the test to really analyze the traffic rather than failing
for talker/listener disconnection.


For FQTSS.c.34.2.5b:

echo fqtss_34.2.5b > sw/msrp_info

This does not pass the test but allow the capture to be manually inspected to
calculate the supposed number of frames received.


For FQTSS.c.34.2.9b:

echo fqtss_34.2.9b > sw/msrp_info

This just shows that using the length 100 for calculation matches the
expectation of the test.


For FQTSS.c.34.2.9c:

echo fqtss_34.2.3 > sw/msrp_info

Occasionally the talker declaration is not sent after a LeaveAll request,
causing the reservation to be dropped and resulting in more frames received.


For BA:

echo ba > sw/msrp_info

This allows the tests to detect receiving the Announce messages it wants so
that there is no delay waiting for them.


The following command is used to reset all workarounds:

echo reset > sw/msrp_info
